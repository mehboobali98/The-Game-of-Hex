# The-Game-of-Hex

An AI agent is created which plays the game of Hex using min-max and alpha-beta pruning to best his human counterparts.

The AI moves are evaluated using the evaluation function in which different heuristics are used to select the best move. The alpha-beta pruning helps in finding the best move faster.
